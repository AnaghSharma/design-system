Cards make it easy to scan for relevant and actionable information by grouping them. Elements, like text and images, should be placed inside them in a way that clearly indicates hierarchy. This way multiple different sections can be created within a page.

Cards can be arranged vertically, horizontally or in a grid.

### Types
<br/>

#### Default

Default card is the most used type of card. It consists of a shadow, `Shadow 10` by default.

### Usage
<br/>

#### Scrolling inside a card
To indicate that the content is scrollable within a card, use a scrollbar. The dividers in the header and the footer should only be shown when the content is scrollable.

<Preview name="default-card" />

#### Highlighting a section
Subdued card is used to highlight a section inside a card. The condition is that this section must be at the edges (bottom, right, etc.) and not somewhere in between.

<Preview name="card-subdued" />

#### Card within a default card
Flat card is used when there is a need to create sections within a default card i.e. card inside a card.

<Preview name="card-card-within-a-card" />

#### Empty card
